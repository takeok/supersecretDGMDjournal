<h1>Takeo's Less than Secret and Somewhat Rushed/Half Remembered DGMD_Journal</h1>
<br>

<p>I conceived of my final project fairly early in the class, maybe our third or second session. I came into the class with an idea that I wanted to create a gift for Larry, my faculty advisor, and Leslie, a fantastic photographer and Larry's wife. Larry has been a fantastic mentor all the time I have been at MIT and they have both helped to nurture my growth and exploration into future academic/professional goals and been instrumental in helping me to recover from a serious personal loss last summer.</p> 
<br>
<p>I had originally thought the gift would be more personal and less polished than the finished site I produced, I also had not originally thought the site would be publically available.</p>
<br>
<p>When we discussed stories, particularly digital stories, I found many of the representations interesting but not very compelling. In particular, I was surprised I didn't like the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek" target="_blank">NYT piece</a> more. I felt almost like one does at a movie, yes some of the effects are neat, but sometimes things are so much more evocative because of the use of your imagination. Also, during this period I began to explore CSS (I felt like I had a decent understanding of HTML) with Alec. We began my looking at some simple items on MIT Drupal sites I was in the process of trying to create to highlight some of our research at MIT. It took me a long time, but finally many of the concepts Alec was describing have sunk in and I really like how the sites have changed (read-exist). You can view them by clicking over to <a href="https://necap.mit.edu/home" target="_blank">NECAP</a>, <a href="http://scienceimpact.mit.edu/" target="_blank">SIC</a> and <a href="https://malaysiacities.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MSCP</a>. (Poor Alec spent about 4-5 hours working with me to get the logic behind those sliders into my head and then I went ahead and moved in a completly different direction). Like everything digital they seem to be ever evolving projects, never truly finished. But revisitng these sites, I am really impressed how much I've learned. Editing in details (and adding working sliders) took a few hours of poking and prodding, not days of frustration.</p>
<br>
<p>I also began my story project <strong>A City in Fourths</strong>. This was a truly daunting project for me because there was a great deal of items (CSS and Java Script) with which I was pretty baffled in dealing with. I tried to dig around in <strong>a-story-in-pomes</strong> and rather than just pulling items over, I wrote individual lines so I could try to understand how they worked. There are definitely still issues with the project but it was incredibly useful to understand how CSS worked (I didn’t really understand the Java Script here). It also got me a little more comfortable searching through MDN or CSS Tricks to try to find effects or answers. I hope to re-visit this project, in particular I know I need to make a front end interface to allow for new material to be easily added. When I originally thought of the story here, I wanted this to be a site where my research team and our friends could upload images and stories about Boston. I think that is a bit of a high branch to grab when you are just starting but I think it would still be worthwhile to revisit in the near future.</p>
<br>
<p>As we moved into the game portion of the course I have to admit my focus was not on games. The quick jump to almost all Java Script made understanding the game meat and bones <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_D_Z-D2tzi14/TNc4MEFzVRI/AAAAAAAAEBo/1mYo8KmVK_o/s640/dogs10.png" onClick="return popup(this, 'dogs')">fairly difficult</a>(borrowed from Allie Brosh). Here I was also already starting to focus more on designing my <a href="http://dgmde15discourse.s3.amazonaws.com/496b2078791c444e06ec1335fa272c4f58b8eb42e2.png" onClick="return popup(this, 'drawing')">final project</a>. I started with the rough sketch (very rough, there were spelling mistakes, I was so excited to be drawing on the computer) of my design which I posted to Discourse. I think it reflected a lot of the lessons I had learned about the type of story telling I was interested in (focused on the story and keeping user interaction a little bit less distracting). It is surprisingly different from my final result, since I thought this was the draft I was going to run with. During this period I experimented with different mock ups for the site both digitally and on a sketch pad, unfortunately I am not a sentimentalist but a minimalist and most of these early drafts did not survive their dismissal. Once I had the layout designed how I liked it (some items similar to their current state) I met with Bakhtiar and Alec to discuss, I think during this meeting we began to layout the initial logic behind the site. This was a great exercise because it focused my idea down and gave me a clear path to proceed down upon. In the classes I think I was taking away bits of logic and the method of construction for Java Script and systems, which it turns out is extremely helpful! So even though I was not really getting every nuance of the code (or it just took more poking after class) I was, unknowingly, gaining a lot of knowledge for the architecture of a project. I also felt obligated to actually research some games and I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfps2HKE4B4" onClick="return popup(this, 'awesomegame')">this game</a> which I think is a genius concept for creating an evocative and engaging open world. I briefly toyed with the idea of creating a choose your own adventure style game, with mostly text, but I felt like this would be pretty much a "I had to do this" instead of a "I am so excited about this project!"</p>

<br>
<p>The next steps in terms of coding my final project are very difficult to describe, because it is a little difficult to describe the first steps at the start of a hike up a mountain because by the time you reach (near) the peak, you’ve somewhat forgotten what it was like to begin. Rather than reaching for specific examples, I think I can safely say where I began to understand how all the elements of code were working together, how to conceive of a problem and a solution in code and how to trouble shoot pesky problems originated with my meetings with Alec. In particular, Alec took the complex idea I was struggling with and stripped it down to the <a href="http://www.toddlertechpreschool.com/ESW/Images/78394964.png" onClick="return popup(this, 'blocks')">simplest form</a>, then we figured out the code for that simple item. Seeing an item addressed in a very simple and logical fashion then helped me to work on my own time, applying the thinking process and code I had seen Alec apply during our one on one meeting. To me, this was critical for where I have ended up during this course. It is easy to just <a href="http://questioncopyright.org/files/images/2011/CID1_MimiMakesCopy.jpg" onClick="return popup(this, 'blocks')">replicate/copy paste (that looks like me when something I copy paste works)</a> things off the web, but it is entirely different to begin to understand how and why they work. I think this model of teaching really encouraged me to work at problems on my own so I understood complexities I would never have done if it were a simple copy paste. I became much more comfortable with Java Script as a result of all this work, to the point where I began to experiment on my own and tried to start writing code entirely independently.  I think reaching this level of confidence within the code was a huge milestone. Additionally, the restructuring of the site’s entire secondary navigation system (which was done very late in the project) seemed like a huge endeavor but I was able to track down a few loose ends and felt comfortable modeling simple squares in a separate page like Alec had taught me, ending in much more concise and neat visual map on the site.</p>
<br>
<p>The site is hosted on MIT <a href="http://web.mit.edu/femalefaces/#" target="_blank">here</a>. It was actually a much more frantic upload than I had hoped. Things just got incredibly busy in the month prior to the launch of the exhibit and there was never enough time to work on all the projects I was juggling. I am, however, very pleased with the site and very proud of all the benchmarks it represents in my coding. I know both Larry and Leslie are very pleased with it as well. I hope to incorporate some images from the Grand Opening, to highlight what an event we managed to host in such an amazingly short amount of time. Here I find myself a little backed up into a corner by the limitations of my site structure, it seems like an easy method to do this would be to create many pop up windows (which I dislike as a digital distraction).  However, I think I may be able to apply some of the lessons learned in the construction of the visual map (on the landing of the page) to build some new content into the structure of the site. This will be an on going process, I am hoping to be able to incorporate many or all of the aspects of the exhibition before it leaves for Malaysia so Leslie has a digital copy of all the talented work she produced.</p>
<br>
<p>And now we round out to my summer projects, there are two projects I am very excited to pursue this summer. Both grew out of projects from our classmates.</p>
<br>
<p>The first is based off the conversation about text drawings. In particular, I really liked the idea of incorporating text into the space of a graphic design. My mother is very much an Agatha Christie fan, in particular she really enjoys Poirot. My idea is to take the text from one of the mysteries (my MCP students assure me it is easy to gain access to text files for all books) and use it to create an image. My problem here is how to finish the delivery of this gift, in particular I feel like this gift may be better received in print, but I am not sure it would fit with my parents décor choices.</p>
<br>
<p>The second project is an animation, I have some scanned sketches I have doodled while trying to pull together the concepts for this gift. One of my close friend loves the book the Little Prince, in particular she really likes the fox. I would like to draw and animate a simple fox for her to play with. At first I thought this would be fun to incorporate into her phone (like all of us, she travels internationally all the time). After seeing our small group final presentations, I think maybe this would be fun to host on a webpage, the fox could be a touch stone for her to connect her back to MIT and all of us here. Like a little, zero weight, digital pet. I am hoping I can tap both the students who tackled this for their final projects and also the DGMD staff if I run into issues realizing this project. I’d like to complete it before July 10/11 which is my friend’s birthday (she was born in Iran and insists the time difference allows for an interpretation of either day).</p>
